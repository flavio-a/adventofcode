# Advent of Code
My solutions to [Advent of Code](adventofcode.com). Each subdir is for one year.

## 2020
My first partecipation. Half Haskell, half C++ solutions. Some solutions have
problems, but they all got me a (two) star(s) in the end. And
[a star is a star](https://github.com/flavio-a/adventofcode/commit/27ebee1ebcdbb9d8b562d28f34640e96c2ab77bb).

## 2021
Second time, started in Rust. I don't know if I'll have the strength to finish
this without going back to Haskell and/or C++, because Rust is really heavy
until you get used to it (eg. I spent 13 minutes to memoize a function, and I
even did it "wrong" using an `unsafe`).

## 20something
I'd like to learn Rust, so I thought to use an old AoC for this purpose. It may
remain a dream for long, but who knows what boredom can do.
