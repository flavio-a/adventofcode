My solutions for [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020/)

## Ugly things
At some point I decided it was time to get back my Haskell skill, so I started
solving problems in Haskell. Since all I want to do is to be able to program in
Haskell again, I used [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)
to install packages since I've already used it in the past, so I know how does
it work and I don't have to learn another (more suitable for this project)
packaging tool.
So I have some solutions in Python and C++, then a stack project directory with
all other solutions written in Haskell. This is quite ugly, but I'm too lazy
to fix it (even though I'm taking my time to write this long and useless
README).
